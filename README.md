# Climate Change Impact on Agriculture (1990–2024)

This Power BI project examines the impact of climate variability on agricultural productivity and economic outcomes across multiple countries and regions between 1990 and 2024. The analysis integrates climatic, agronomic, and management variables to assess yield performance, climate risk, and adaptation effectiveness.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard presents a multi-dimensional analysis of climate–agriculture interactions using interactive filters for **Year, Region, Country, and Crop Type**.

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Total Crop Yield:** 22.4K MT/HA  
- **Total Economic Impact:** USD 6.74 million  

These indicators summarise cumulative agricultural output and climate-related economic consequences over the study period.

## Visual Analytics and Interpretation

### 1. Average Crop Yield by Year
This time-series visual illustrates interannual variability in average crop yield. Fluctuations reflect the influence of climate variability and extreme weather events, with no consistent linear trend, highlighting increasing production uncertainty under changing climatic conditions.

**Insight:**  
Crop yield exhibits strong temporal variability, consistent with climate-induced production instability.

---

### 2. Economic Impact by Country (Map)
The geographic distribution visual shows average economic impacts attributed to climate effects across countries.

**Insight:**  
Economic losses are spatially heterogeneous, indicating unequal vulnerability and adaptive capacity across regions.

---

### 3. Extreme Weather Events vs Yield and Economic Loss
This clustered bar chart categorises extreme weather events into **low, medium, and high** frequency groups and compares crop yield against associated economic losses.

**Insight:**  
Higher frequencies of extreme weather events are associated with increased economic losses and diminishing yield returns.

---

### 4. Temperature vs Crop Yield (Binned Analysis)
A binned bar chart is used to capture the non-linear relationship between average temperature and crop yield.

**Insight:**  
Crop yield increases within moderate temperature ranges but plateaus or declines under temperature extremes, confirming a non-linear climate–yield response.

---

### 5. Total Crop Yield by Country
This comparative bar chart highlights cumulative crop yield contributions by country.

**Insight:**  
Differences in national yield performance reflect variations in climate exposure, soil health, and agricultural management practices.

---

### 6. Crop Yield by Soil Health Group
This visual groups soil health into qualitative classes and compares average crop yield across these groups.

**Insight:**  
Better soil health is consistently associated with higher average yields, reinforcing soil quality as a key productivity driver.

---

### 7. Adaptation Strategies Performance Table
The table compares adaptation strategies (crop rotation, drought-resistant crops, organic farming) across three indicators:
- Average crop yield  
- Average economic impact  
- Average soil health index  

**Insight:**  
Adaptation strategies are associated with improved soil health and yield stability, while reducing economic vulnerability to climate stress.

---

## Key Findings
- Crop yield responds non-linearly to temperature and precipitation.
- Extreme weather events significantly increase economic losses.
- Soil health is a stronger predictor of yield than input intensity alone.
- Climate adaptation strategies enhance resilience and productivity.
- Climate impacts on agriculture are unevenly distributed across regions.
